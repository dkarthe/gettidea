With most of us learning about Heartbleed recently, and the subsequent scramble of web service providers to patch the vulnerability, it appears a consensus is forming around the need for updating your passwords.

The trouble is, many of us have trouble setting unique passwords for each web service we use. You probably know the problem with the single password strategy; if someone learns the password to one website, they have the keys to several others. And that can be a problem.

And this is precisely where [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) becomes invaluable. Because LastPass will do the remembering, you can set strong and unique passwords for the websites you use.

Here's a video I created at work that gives you a crash course on setting up LastPass, including setting unique passwords for the websites you use.

LastPass asks that you only remember one password. It does not store the password, that's your responsibility to remember. The master password you set, however, is used as a key to encrypt and decrypt information you do store in LastPass.

I've been using LastPass for a long time now. The utility of this software makes it a must have for your online toolkit.
