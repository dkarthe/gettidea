Moving to a Linux operating system has never been easier for a Windows user. This weekend, I used the wubi installer to load ubuntu, a Debian based GNU/Linux operating system on to my laptop.

The wubi installer allows you to install and unistall ubuntu just like any other program in Windows. Certainly takes both the fear and thrill out of trying out a Linux operating system.I'm enjoying the short time it takes me, relative to Windows 7, to get on the web.

Ubuntu is fairly intuitive and easy to use at the basic level. By basic level, I mean, "function" and get things done relative to your Windows habits. When  you move into personalizing the operating system to your specifc tastes, it can get a bit exotic.

I understand some people don't like change in the applications they use. To them I say, pause, and take stock of the computing enviroment we're in. We're all getting very used to changing user interfaces. Facebook, Twitter, our online banking, email, internet browsers, mobile devices, and so on.

With Ubuntu, you have a chance to see a desktop conceived differently. Try it, but not for a short time. Live with it a little, it's fun.
