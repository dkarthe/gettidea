Have you had a chance to check out [RebelMouse](http://www.rebelmouse.com/)? It's nice.

What I like is that RebelMouse makes my website [home page](https://www.rahidelvi.ca/) appear as if some techno-wizardry was in play.

That might be the case, but certainly not by me.

In fact, it's just a clean embed of my aggregated social media activity.

Social bookmarking platforms enabling something like this would be nice.

Still early, the experience can change.
