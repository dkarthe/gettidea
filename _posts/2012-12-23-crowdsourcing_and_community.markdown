![2 reasons why the term "crowdsourcing" bugs me, by opensourceway][1]

For relatively complex problems, narrowing the scope of  "crowdsourcing" to just labour, misses the importance of cultivating community. 

Jimmy Wales clarifies why he's opposed to the term "crowdsourcing" mid-way in a great talk he delivered at Yale University in 2009. I recommend listening to the whole talk, but skip to 25:39 if you're short on time.

The next time you run into "crowdsourcing", try and have a look  what's being done to steward the participants. If you think you're seeing a healthy community, a successful collaboration may be in the making. If the community aspect is being overlooked, that endeavour may have little traction.
