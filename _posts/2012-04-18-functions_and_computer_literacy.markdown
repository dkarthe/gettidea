Taking a moment to impart what a function means can go a long way in promoting computer literacy, especially when navigating around 'computer problems'.

The concept is simple: a function maps a specific output to a set of inputs. You put this, this, and/or this _in_, you get _that_ out.

In practice, we're often more likely to apply rather than ponder over the inner workings of functions. That's probably why they're sometimes explained in terms of a 'black box'. We specify the input and see the output, but don't necessarily know what happens inside the opaque box. In this sense, computers literally are black boxes for many of us.

So how does this relate to resolving computer problems? Just hitting a key on your  keyboard triggers layers of computing before something appears on your screen. Something could be wrong at any one of those layers and be causing the "computer  problem". And what is a "computer problem"?

For [Professor Harry Lewis](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/open-learning-initiative/bits-computer-science-course), a computer problem is almost always a human (induced) problem. A computer is often *correctly executing* an instruction which some person gave incorrectly.

The faulty instruction could be executing down at the code layer, like what happened with [Comair](http://oli.extension.harvard.edu/cscie2/2009/spring/lectures/cscie2-L03-20090202_3-1b.flv?play) for instance, or on the top, at the keystroke level, the stuff that you and I type in.

And that's the good news, computers still respond to input. Fix the input, and if the 'function' or 'black box' is alright, your output should be too.
