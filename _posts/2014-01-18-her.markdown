Her might have been a nicer movie if I hadn’t watched A.I. Artificial Intelligence, or Robot and Frank _and_, if I hadn’t known of John Searle’s Chinese room argument.

A.I. Artificial Intelligence had a virtually believable ‘machine’ character. Robot and Frank had a convincing ‘relationship’ between a human and machine. Theodore and Samantha? Yawn.

And I hesitate to say Her captured the zeitgeist of our time. It’s possible I missed something obvious.
